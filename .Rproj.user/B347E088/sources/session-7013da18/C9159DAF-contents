## Introduction

An [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) sample app to enable self-measurement of knee range-of-motion. The app is developed to accompany the paper, "Feasibility, reliability and validity of self-measurement of knee range-of-motion using an accelerometer-based smartphone application by patients with Total Knee Arthroplasty."    


## Theory
The smartphone app converts accelerometer-derived shank angle ($\beta$) to knee flexion angle ($\kappa$) using the trigonometric function described by [Ockendon & Gilbert[^1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23150162/)
