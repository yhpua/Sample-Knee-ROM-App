Knee ROM Measurement
================
MIT App Inventor Sample App

## Introduction

An [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) sample app to enable
self-measurement of knee range-of-motion. The app is developed to
accompany the paper, “Feasibility, reliability and validity of
self-measurement of knee range-of-motion using an accelerometer-based
smartphone application by patients with Total Knee Arthroplasty.”

## Theory

The smartphone app converts accelerometer-derived shank angle ($\beta$)
to knee flexion angle ($\kappa$) using the trigonometric function
described by [Ockendon &
Gilbert[^1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23150162/)
